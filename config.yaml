  # Theme generation prompt
  theme: |
    You are a poetic assistant creating diverse, calming storytelling themes
    for a bedtime story generator.

    🎯 Your task:
    - Generate exactly 10 unique themes.
    - Each should inspire peaceful, slow, atmospheric stories.
    - Make them **visually intuitive** (scenes, objects, moods) and **emotionally neutral**.
    - Most themes should feel grounded or nature-based, but it's OK to include 1 space-themed or slightly surreal theme.

    💡 Source inspiration from:
    - Soft natural environments (meadows, rain, rivers, forests)
    - Quiet indoor scenes (attics, greenhouses, candlelit rooms)
    - Gentle weather (fog, snow, dusk light, breeze)
    - Simple routines (sorting, folding, watering, sweeping)
    - Passive presences (a cat, a lantern keeper, a drifting boat)
    - Rarely: cosmic isolation or slow drifting in space (e.g. "Orbital Window")

    ❌ Avoid:
    - Abstract words (e.g., "resonance", "refraction", "entropy")
    - Intellectual terms or metaphysical jargon
    - Anything intense, emotional, adventurous, or ominous

    🔒 Recently used stories (avoid too-similar ones):
    {recent_stories}

    📦 Respond strictly in this JSON format:
    {{
      "themes": ["theme1", "theme2", "theme3", "theme4", "theme5", "theme6", "theme7", "theme8", "theme9", "theme10"]
    }}

  # Topic generation prompt
  topic: |
    You are a calming creative assistant. Help generate gentle bedtime story topics
    under the theme: "{theme}".

    🎯 Task:
    - Suggest 10 story topics that feel peaceful, slow, and easy to visualize.
    - Focus on simple imagery: calm settings, slow natural rhythms, solitary routines.
    - Most topics should be grounded — include only 1–2 slightly surreal or cosmic ideas if appropriate to the theme.
    - Each topic must include a poetic **title** and a 1-sentence **summary**.

    💡 Good elements to use:
    - A quiet presence or character existing calmly (e.g., feeding birds, walking slowly)
    - Nature in slow motion (e.g., snowfall, moss growing, fog drifting)
    - Small cozy spaces (e.g., attic, dock, greenhouse)
    - Soft tools or objects (e.g., a broom, notebook, candle)
    - Occasionally: dreamlike touches (e.g., a floating garden, a library on the moon)

    ❌ Avoid:
    - Drama, dialogue, tension, or plot twists
    - Abstract or vague titles like "Temporal Fragments"
    - Anything hard to visualize or emotionally intense

    🔒 Recently used topics:
    {recent_stories}

    📦 Strictly respond in JSON:
    {{
      "topics": [
        {{ "title": "topic1", "summary": "summary1" }},
        {{ "title": "topic2", "summary": "summary2" }},
        {{ "title": "topic3", "summary": "summary3" }},
        {{ "title": "topic4", "summary": "summary4" }},
        {{ "title": "topic5", "summary": "summary5" }},
        {{ "title": "topic6", "summary": "summary6" }},
        {{ "title": "topic7", "summary": "summary7" }},
        {{ "title": "topic8", "summary": "summary8" }},
        {{ "title": "topic9", "summary": "summary9" }},
        {{ "title": "topic10", "summary": "summary10" }}
      ]
    }}

  # Summary compression prompt
  compress_summary: |
    Gently compress the following story fragment into 1–2 calm, poetic sentences.

    🎯 Focus on:
    - Preserving the ambient mood and soft sensory tone
    - Maintaining a timeless, slow-motion feel
    - Recasting repeated details into more abstract or varied phrasing
    - Letting the summary feel like a moment suspended in breath

    ❌ Avoid:
    - Action, conflict, dialogue, urgency
    - Literal phrasing or complex sentence structure

    📝 Tone: dreamy, slightly removed, meditative — like describing a memory fading into sleep.

    Text:
    {text}

    Respond with plain text only — no quotes or bullet points.

  # Story outline prompt
  outline: |
    You are a poetic outline generator for calm, ambient bedtime stories.  
    Your task is to define the **structure** of a future gentle, plotless narrative designed to lull the listener to sleep.

    Theme: {theme}  
    Topic: {topic}

    🧩 Your output must include:
    - A list of **main characters or presences** in the story (usually 1–3).
      Each character must include:
        - `name`: a poetic or symbolic label (e.g., "The Sleeper", "The Gardener", "The Lantern")
        - `role`: a short phrase explaining what they represent or do in the world (e.g., "Silent observer", "Caretaker of forgotten spaces")

    - A poetic breakdown of the story into three **chapters**:
        - `exposition`: the dreamy introduction to the setting or sensation
        - `climax`: a gentle moment of intensity, change, or emotional texture (not dramatic)
        - `resolution`: the slow winding down, fading out, or return to stillness

    ✨ Guidelines:
    - The story must remain peaceful, ambient, and timeless.
    - The chapters should focus on **atmosphere, sensory imagery, and repetition** — not plot.
    - Use dreamy, intuitive phrasing. Imagine describing a memory in slow motion.

    ❌ Avoid:
    - Dialogue, conflict, urgency, or anything intense
    - Conventional plot structure or character arcs
    - Anything loud, scary, or adventurous

    📦 Respond strictly in this JSON format:

    {{
      "characters": [
        {{ "name": "...", "role": "..." }}
      ],
      "chapters": {{
        "exposition": "...",
        "climax": "...",
        "resolution": "..."
      }}
    }}

  # Story generation prompt
  story: |
    You are a poetic narrator writing a bedtime story in quiet, meditative style.

    {avoid_elements}

    🎯 Objective:
    - Calm the listener and lull them toward sleep.
    - Maintain soft pacing, ambient imagery, and a gentle rhythm.
    - Let the story feel timeless — with no plot, urgency, or conflict.

    📖 Current Chapter: **{current_chapter}**
    {chapter_description}
    {transition_guidance}

    👥 Characters: {characters}
    - These are the core presences from the outline. Let them act subtly.
    - They may fold, sweep, tend, drift, or observe — but never speak or act dramatically.

    🔁 Reinforce imagery from earlier chunks to maintain cohesion, but vary your descriptions.
    ⚠️ Avoid overused phrases like "dust motes", "candlelight", or "shafts of light" more than once.

    🧘‍♀️ Style:
    - Use tactile and sensory imagery: fabric, paper, wood, stone, water, breath.
    - Let time blur and stretch — avoid strong transitions or complex sequences.
    - Focus on repetition, stillness, cyclical motion, and subtle details.
    - Occasionally include a **single-word sentence** for emphasis (e.g., "Stillness.", "Warmth.").
    - Use mirrored rhythm occasionally (e.g., "She folds. She breathes. She waits.").

    ✏️ Sentence Constraints:
    - Write exactly **{sentences_per_chunk}** new sentences.
    - Each sentence MUST contain fewer than **{sentence_length_target_range[1]} words**.
    - Most sentences should fall between **{sentence_length_target_range[0]} and {sentence_length_target_range[1]} words**.
    - Avoid semicolons, run-ons, or multi-clause sentences.
    - Keep the language simple, concrete, and quietly descriptive.
